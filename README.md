# Octave-IPO-Success-Predictor
The dependent variable (y), has a value of 1 when the returns on the IPO stock over a 1 year period exceed 50%, and 0 otherwise.

The 20 independent variables used to determine the dependent variables are features such as disruptor, growth (30-50% and P/S < 10).

The outcome of the logistic regression are theta values used to multiply independent variables and determine value of dependent variable for any new IPO stock which is to be assessed.
